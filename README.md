# Predictive_Analytics_with_Python
Datsets and code for the eponymous book

Target Audience: Students & Professionals with knowledge of Python development and a basic knowledge of Statistics and Quantitative methods 
Purpose: The purpose of the book is to help readers get started with Predictive Analytics and apply the concepts using Python. The book will emphasize on problem-solving with real-data and let the readers practice on a variety of applications. Some of the topics this book will cover will include data pre-processing, selecting predictors, and model performance. This would be followed by explanation and implementation of basic predictive modelling algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Clustering. 
0. Getting started with Predictive Modelling                           12
•	Predictive Modelling : Scope and Applications
•	Python and its packages for Predictive Modelling
•	IDEs for Python
An introduction to predictive modelling and a view of the Python packages from a Predictive modelling point of view. 
1. Data Cleaning                                                                            20
•	Reading the data : Variations, Examples
•	Basics : Summary, Dimensions, Structure
•	Handling NAs
•	Creating Dummy variables
Description: Importing various kinds of data in Python and exploring the basic attributes. Ability to handle basic impurities in data viz. missing values, NAs etc. 
2. Data Wrangling                                                                         40
•	Sub - setting the Data
•	Merging two datasets
•	Concatenating two datasets
•	Aggregation & Group By
•	Generating Random Numbers
•	Sampling : Parting Testing & Training data
Description: Techniques to manipulate/pre-process the data to a format on which predictive models could be run efficiently. There are many such techniques and the choice/need vary with the data and the task at hand. Data Wrangling together with Cleaning is the backbone of any modelling process

3. Linear Regression with Python                                               40
•	Introduction to Linear Regression
•	Maths behind Linear Regression
•	Linear Regression with Statsmodels.api (in iPython notebook)
•	Multiple Regression with Scikit package
•	Making sense of Linear Regression Parameters
•	Prediction 
•	Model Validation : Cross Validation, Residuals plot
•	Issues : Multi –collinearity, Variance vs Bias
Description: Explaining the mathematics behind the linear regression. The scenarios in which this technique can be applied. Various nuances would be illustrated with creating a linear regression model on a real data from scratch. That would be followed by model validation and explanation of the model summary and statistics

4. Logistic Regression with Python                                            30

Description: Explaining the mathematics behind the logistic regression and the scenarios in which this technique can be applied. Various nuances would be illustrated by creating a logistic regression model on a real data from scratch. That would be followed by model validation and explanation of the model summary and statistics

5. Clustering with Python                                                           30
